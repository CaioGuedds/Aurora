Hi, I would love to see Aurora working with effects options for keyboards like g413, it would be very nice to have effects (waves, propagate, stars among other lighting effects since the keyboard is not RGB, but I believe I support these effects, since in the software of Logitech it comes equipped with only the breathing effect.
I loved the Aurora initiative
